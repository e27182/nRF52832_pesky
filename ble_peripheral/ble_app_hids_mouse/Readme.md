# BLE: HID Mouse

Adaptation of ble_app_hids_mouse example from Nordic Semi SDK. It reuses source code from original folder in SDK, just Makefile is adapted.

After flashing you should see board as "Nordic_Mouse" with mouse icon on your phone/tablet/PC.

When connecting BSP buttons/pins 8,9,11,12 to GND mouse cursor should appear on the screen and move in some direction.
